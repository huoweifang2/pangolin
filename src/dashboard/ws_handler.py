"""
Dashboard WebSocket Handler — Real-Time Event Broadcasting.

Pushes firewall events to all connected God Mode Console clients via
WebSocket. This is the server-side counterpart of the Vue 3 dashboard.

Architecture:
  • A single broadcast hub maintains the set of connected clients.
  • Events are pushed from the interceptor via `emit_dashboard_event()`.
  • Each client receives events as JSON, filtered by their subscription.
  • Backpressure: if a client falls behind, events are dropped (not queued
    indefinitely) to prevent memory exhaustion from slow consumers.

Wire protocol (server → client):
  {
    "event_type": "request" | "alert" | "verdict" | "stats",
    "timestamp": 1700000000.0,
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "payload_preview": "{...}",
    "analysis": { ... },
    "is_alert": true
  }

Wire protocol (client → server):
  {
    "action": "block" | "allow",     // Human-in-the-loop verdict
    "request_id": "abc123"           // The escalated request to act on
  }
